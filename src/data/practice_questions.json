          "options": ["A) Yes", "B) No"],
          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "Yes! It's proportional because: 2 ÷ 4 = 0.5 and 4 ÷ 8 = 0.5. The ratio is always the same (0.5 or $0.50 per banana)."

          "options": ["A) Yes", "B) No"],
          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "No! The $5 starting fee means you don't pay $0 for 0 miles - you pay $5 just to get in! This 'starting amount' makes it NOT proportional."
